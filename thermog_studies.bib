	abstract = {* Ectotherms rely heavily on the spatial variance of environmental conditions to thermoregulate. Theoretically, their fitness is maximized when they can find suitable microhabitats by moving over short distances – this condition is met when spatial variance is high at fine spatial scales. Strikingly, despite the diversity of organisms living in leaf microhabitats, little is known about the impact of warming on the spatial variance of climatic conditions at the scale of individual leaf surfaces.


* Here, we used experimental manipulation of ambient conditions to quantify the effects of environmental change on the thermal heterogeneity within individual leaf surfaces. We also explored the implications for behavioural thermoregulation by arthropods at a single leaf surface.


* Using thermography, we characterized the apple leaf microclimate in terms of span and spatial aggregation of surface temperatures across a range of air temperatures and relative humidities. Then, we assessed how thermal heterogeneity within individual leaves affected behavioural thermoregulation by the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) under both near-optimal and sublethal conditions in this microhabitat. We measured the upper lethal temperature threshold of the mite to define sublethal exposure.


* Thermal heterogeneity of individual leaves was driven mainly by ambient air temperature. Higher air temperatures gave both smaller ranges and higher spatial aggregation of temperatures at the leaf surface, such that the leaf microclimate was homogenized.


* Tetranychus urticae used behavioural thermoregulation at moderate air temperature, when thermal heterogeneity was high at the leaf surface. At higher air temperature, however, heterogeneity declined and spider mites did not perform behavioural thermoregulation.


* Warming decreases thermal heterogeneity of leaf surfaces with critical implications for arthropods – behavioural thermoregulation alone is not sufficient to escape the heat in the leaf microhabitat. Information on spatial variance of microclimatic conditions is critical for estimating how readily organisms can buffer global warming by moving.},

	abstract = {A majority of agricultural pests are influenced by microclimatic conditions that affect their performance and occurrence. Thermal heterogeneity experienced by pests at fine spatial scales is potentially a key to understand pest dynamics, yet its study over entire fields at fine resolution has never been performed. We used aerial infrared thermography to yield high-resolution measurements of crop canopy temperatures in 38 potato fields in the Ecuadorian Andes. In each field, for 30 different plots, we characterized the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of crop canopy temperatures and simultaneously sampled populations of four common leaf-surface dwelling adult pests. We then evaluated the fine-scale thermal heterogeneity implications for pest occurrence and compared a variety of thermal spatial metrics with pest abundance and richness measured in field. We found that the range of temperatures available for pests in crop canopies was independent on scale: pests can access within few centimetres most of the thermal microenvironments recorded at the field level. Also, the availability of thermal microenvironments was dependent on solar radiations: with increasing radiation levels, pests have to travel less distance to reach a variety of thermal environments. At the plot level, we found that the four-studied pests were not clumped into their optimal thermal conditions but rather distributed evenly. Pests having a wide range of favourable microenvironments available within very short distances might be constrained by others factors (resources, enemies). However, we found that pest richness was significantly correlated to both thermal aggregation and diversity index, suggesting that more diverse and distinctly distributed thermal environments in crop fields shelter a higher diversity of pests. As environmental conservation and agronomical management increasingly depend on our ability to understand and predict the responses of species to their environment, we recommend refining global pest distribution predictions using fine-grained microclimatic models to infer accurate responses of organism to climate change. Indeed, fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity of microclimates might provide organisms with more than enough suitable thermal habitats in their actual location to withstand global changes.},

Current assessments of thermal heterogeneity in complex environments are predominately characterized by ambient temperature. This omission of solar radiation may lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding thermoregulation and distribution of species. We use thermal cameras to gather data on temperature heterogeneity in structurally complex rain forest environments. Using thermographic photographs, we capture the multidimensionality of climate created by vegetation by collecting over 76,000 temperature samples within approximately 1 m2 quadrats. The method was tested against three standard methods that record air temperature to determine possible omissions in capturing thermal heterogeneity in four geographic locations—Colombia, Borneo, Madagascar, and Australia. Across all locations, there was greater thermal heterogeneity in surface temperature than captured from ambient temperature technologies. Spatial variability in surface temperature on 1 d was greater than temporal variability of ambient temperature across the entire month, with extreme deviation from ambient temperatures. Importantly, when compared to the lower bounds for optimal performance for five tropical Anolis species, this technology captured thermal regimes that support the thermoregulatory needs of these species, whereas ambient air temperature methods suggested that these species would be in thermal debt. Sampling surface temperature at high resolutions across space in combination with intensive sampling of ambient temperature and informed spatial modeling should improve our understanding of the distribution of ectothermic species living within thermally heterogeneous environments.},

	abstract = {* A major barrier for the scientific community of climate change biologists is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the resolution at which global climate data are collected and modelled. Thus, the development of integrative and quantitative tools for the monitoring and spatial characterization of microclimates across spatial scales is a key issue for climate change ecologists.


* We proposed an integrative toolbox for quantifying the spatial heterogeneity in surface temperatures by bringing together procedures of unmanned aerial vehicles, thermal imagery, orthomosaic, GIS classification and spatial metrics. This toolbox permits to yield high-resolution visual and infrared orthoimages that are processed into a GIS for selecting surfaces of interest in the landscape (e.g. soil, vegetation). Then, the thermal matrices of selected surfaces (i.e. temperature values of the pixels belonging to the selected surfaces only) are processed within r to generate a variety of thermal landscape metrics (e.g. thermal patch richness and density, thermal aggregation and cohesion index).


* We applied this toolbox to the thermal characterization of mountainous agricultural landscapes in Ecuador with implications for ectothermic pest dynamics. UAV flights at a height of 60 m above-ground level allowed us to acquired high-resolution visual and thermal images (1 and 5 cm/pixel, respectively) for 12 potato fields with a mean surface of 1017 ± 117 m2. Landscape metrics on plant and soil surfaces showed that crop phenology drives the spatial patterns of surface temperatures and strongly modifies the overall thermal ecology of crop fields, with potential implications for ectothermic pest occurrence and dynamics.


* Overall, our toolbox affords a timely and innovative methodological framework to better assess the thermal heterogeneity of natural landscapes across a wide range of spatial scales. In particular, this toolbox would be of topical interest for ecologists trying to bridge the gap between the resolution of their climatic data and the body size of their study organisms.},

	abstract = {Tropical rainforests are subject to extensive degradation by commercial selective logging. Despite pervasive changes to forest structure, selectively logged forests represent vital refugia for global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to buffer temperature-sensitive species from climate warming will be an important determinant of their future conservation value, although this topic remains largely unexplored. Thermal buffering potential is broadly determined by: (i) the difference between the “macroclimate” (climate at a local scale, m to ha) and the “microclimate” (climate at a fine-scale, mm to m, that is distinct from the macroclimate); (ii) thermal stability of microclimates (e.g. variation in daily temperatures); and (iii) the availability of microclimates to organisms. We compared these metrics in undisturbed primary forest and intensively logged forest on Borneo, using thermal images to capture cool microclimates on the surface of the forest floor, and information from dataloggers placed inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter. Although major differences in forest structure remained 9–12 years after repeated selective logging, we found that logging activity had very little effect on thermal buffering, in terms of macroclimate and microclimate temperatures, and the overall availability of microclimates. For 1°C warming in the macroclimate, temperature inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter warmed slightly more in primary forest than in logged forest, but the effect amounted to {\textless}0.1°C difference between forest types. We therefore conclude that selectively logged forests are similar to primary forests in their potential for thermal buffering, and subsequent ability to retain temperature-sensitive species under climate change. Selectively logged forests can play a crucial role in the long-term maintenance of global biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Darwin's finches have been the focus of intense study demonstrating how climatic fluctuations coupled with resource competition drive the evolution of a variety of bill sizes and shapes. The bill, as other peripheral surfaces, also plays an important role in thermoregulation in numerous bird species. The avian bill is vascularized, while limbs have specialized vasculature that facilitate heat loss or heat conservation (i.e. they are thermoregulatory windows). The Galápagos Islands, home to Darwin's finches, have a hot and relatively dry climate for approximately half of the year, during which thermoregulatory windows (i.e. surfaces) could be important for thermoregulation and the linked challenge of water balance. We hypothesized that Darwin's finch bills have evolved in part for their role in thermoregulation, possibly co-opted, following adaptation for other functions, such as foraging. We predicted that bills of Darwin's finches are effective thermoregulatory windows, and that species differences in bill morphology, along with physiology and behaviour, lead to differences in thermoregulatory function. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a field study to assess heat exchange and microclimate use in three ground finch species and sympatric cactus finch (Geospiza spp.). We collected thermal images of free-living birds during a hot and dry season and recorded microclimate data for each observation. We used individual thermographic data to model the contribution of bills, legs and bodies to overall heat balance and compared surface temperatures to those from dead birds to test physiological control of heat loss from these surfaces. We derived and compared species-specific threshold environmental temperatures, which are indicative of a species’ thermally neutral temperature. In all species, the bill surface was an effective heat dissipater during naturally occurring warm temperatures. As expected, we found that finches controlled surface temperatures through physiology and that young birds had higher surface temperatures than adults. Larger bills contributed proportionally more to overall heat loss than smaller bills. We demonstrate here that related, sympatric species with different bill sizes exhibit different patterns in the use of these thermoregulatory structures, supporting a role for thermoregulation in the evolution and ecology of Darwin's finch morphology.

	abstract = {Restoration status of forest rehabilitation areas can be assessed by comparing their ecosystem characteristics with those of a reference system, most often what is considered the natural climax vegetation. However, comprehensive measurements needed for a traditional vegetation description are often hard or impractical in complex (sub)tropical ecosystems. Therefore, an alternative approach is the identification of simple indicators of ecosystem integrity. The use of such indicators can speed up the availability of resource inventories and thus contribute to the accelerated implementation of successful rehabilitation practices. Thermal buffer capacity (TBC) of ecosystems has been previously proposed as an overall indicator of ecosystem integrity. In this article, sequential surface-temperature measurements are proposed as a method for TBC assessment of different land-use types. Surface temperatures of seven land units in central Tigray (northern Ethiopia), each with a uniform land-use type (degraded and bushy grazing land, enriched and non-enriched rehabilitation area, and forest), were measured with a hand-held infrared thermometer in the rainy and the dry season. Surface-temperature models were derived by means of quadratic regression. Cross-correlation functions were calculated for all possible pairs of land-unit time-series data. Instantaneous heat-up rates, average TBC, and accumulated heat load were calculated. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the effect of aspect and protection status on TBC. Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks for small samples was used to test the significance of differences in heat-up rates and heat load among land-use groups. Time lags between land-unit surface temperatures are caused by differences in aspect rather than land-use type. Protection status and aspect have a significant effect on the average TBC. Results clearly demonstrate a differentiation between protected (low heat-up rate) and non-protected areas (high heat-up rate). Overall ranking suggests that the remnant forest has the highest TBC of all surveyed land-use types, followed by the enriched protected area. Results of this study show that TBC quickly responds to area closure and can therefore be used to monitor the development of protected areas. It is strongly recommended that a detailed monitoring strategy for protected areas on the basis of this technology be devised, validated, and finally transferred to the local communities.},

	abstract = {Aims The sign of interactions among plants in very harsh environments is under debate. The Antarctic tundra is one of the harshest environments on Earth and only two vascular plants (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have successfully established natural populations. D. antarctica mostly establishes facilitative interactions with other species (mosses), but there is no information about the inter-specific interactions established by C. quitensis. We assessed whether C. quitensis grows frequently associated with D. antarctica, and if D. antarctica neighbours have a positive effect on the survival, growth and photochemical efficiency of C. quitensis individuals. Location King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Methods To assess the spatial association among the two Antarctic vascular plants fifty 50 m × 50 cm quadrats were sampled on each of four different substrates: moss carpet areas; dead moss carpet areas dominated by D. antarctica; a transition zone between dead moss carpets and fellfields; and fellfields characterized by very poor vegetation cover. Infrared thermal images were taken to estimate whether growth associated with D. antarctica affected the foliar temperature of C. quitensis. The importance of D. antarctica neighbours on the growth, survival and photochemical efficiency of C. quitensis was evaluated with a neighbour removal experiment. Results The number of C. quitensis individuals associated with D. antarctica was significantly higher than when growing alone in the moss carpet and the dead moss carpet, while in the transition zone there was a trend in that direction. C. quitensis individuals growing associated with D. antarctica were bigger than those growing alone in these three substrate types. In the fellfield site there were no significant differences, neither in the number nor the size of individuals when growing alone or associated with D. antarctica. Foliar temperature of C. quitensis individuals associated with D. antarctica was slightly (1.1°C) but significantly higher than in those growing alone. The growth, survival and photochemical efficiency of C. quitensis individuals with neighbours were higher than in individuals with neighbours removed. Conclusions Our results indicate that D. antarctica has a facilitative effect on the growth, survival and photochemical efficiency of C. quitensis. Thus, facilitative interactions are present and are important in one of the harshest environments on Earth, although results from the fellfield site indicate that further research is needed.},

This study explored the major environmental variables which were thought to be correlated with body temperatures (BTs) of the tropical snail Littoraria scabra at the niche level. A correlation between BT and substrate temperature (ST) was detected from field observations which suggests a possible causal relationship between both substrate and BTs. In contrast, there was no correlation between BT and air temperature. Field observations suggest that 33.4 °C may be L. scabra upper limit of substrate surface temperature, although further experiments are needed to assess if the upper limit of physiological tolerance is actually different. As L. scabra individuals were free to choose their substrata, the observed distribution pattern at the niche level is related to L. scabra's behavior. Additionally, substrate surface temperatures were very heterogeneous at centimeter scale (i.e. from 22.5 to 53.1 °C) and L. scabra was shown to select specific STs (i.e. between 22.5 and 33.4 °C) rather than microhabitat type. Therefore, L. scabra did not seem to behaviorally thermoregulate through microhabitat selection nor aggregation. In contrast, behavioral experiments showed that L. scabra has the ability to actively select a thermally favorable site over short temporal scale (i.e. individual average speed of 1.26 cm min−1) following exposure to high temperatures above 33.4 °C. Hence, this study supports the crucial need to integrate intertidal invertebrate behavioral responses to thermal constraints in climate change studies.},

	abstract = {Intertidal organisms are vulnerable to global warming as they already live at, or near to, the upper limit of their thermal tolerance window. The behaviour of ectotherms could, however, dampen their limited physiological abilities to respond to climate change (e.g. drier and warmer environmental conditions) which could substantially increase their survival rates. The behaviour of ectotherms is still mostly overlooked in climate change studies. Here, we investigate the potential of aggregation behaviour to compensate for climate change in an intertidal gastropod species (Nerita atramentosa) in South Australia. We used thermal imaging to investigate (1) the heterogeneity in individual snail water content and body temperature and surrounding substratum temperature on two topographically different habitats (i.e. rock platform and boulders) separated by 250 m at both day- and night-times, (2) the potential relationship between environment temperature (air and substratum) and snail water content and body temperature, and (3) the potential buffering effect of aggregation behaviour on snail water content and body temperature. Both substratum and snail temperature were more heterogeneous at small spatial scales (a few centimetres to a few metres) than between habitats. This reinforces the evidence that mobile intertidal ectotherms could survive locally under warmer conditions if they can locate and move behaviourally in local thermal refuges. N. atramentosa behaviour, water content and body temperature during emersion seem to be related to the thermal stability and local conditions of the habitat occupied. Aggregation behaviour reduces both desiccation and heat stresses but only on the boulder field. Further investigations are required to identify the different behavioural strategies used by ectothermic species to adapt to heat and dehydrating conditions at the habitat level. Ultimately, this information constitutes a fundamental prerequisite to implement conservation management plans for ectothermic species identified as vulnerable in the warming climate.},

The state and properties of the studied objects and organisms can be evaluated by analyzing images of temperature distribution on their surface. Thermography has numerous practical applications, including in construction, industry, and the military and civil services. In natural sciences, thermal imaging techniques support safe and non-invasive measurements and the acquisition of results that cannot be obtained by any other method. Infrared thermography also creates a wide range of applications for human and veterinary medicine, ecology, zoology, and other natural sciences. Thermal imaging equipment is used to detect injuries, inflammations, and infectious diseases to control reproduction (detection of estrus and pregnancy, determination of male fertility) and lactation processes. The discussed method is applied to investigate thermoregulation in animals, to analyze the effect of environmental factors on animal behavior, to localize individuals and their habitats, and to determine the size of wildlife populations. Despite a wide range of practical applications, thermal imaging has a number of limitations which should be taken into account in studies that rely on infrared thermography techniques.},

	abstract = {Parasites, by definition, extract energy from their hosts and thus affect trophic and food web dynamics even when the parasite may have limited effects on host population size. We studied the energetic costs of mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in wolves (Canis lupus) using thermal cameras to estimate heat losses associated with compromised insulation during the winter. We combined the field data of known, naturally infected wolves with a data set on captive wolves with shaved patches of fur as a positive control to simulate mange-induced hair loss. We predict that during the winter in Montana, more severe mange infection increases heat loss by around 5.2–12 MJ per night (1,240–2,850 kcal, or a 65–78\% increase) for small and large wolves, respectively, accounting for wind effects. To maintain body temperature would require a significant proportion of a healthy wolf's total daily energy demands (18–22 MJ/day). We also predict how these thermal costs may increase in colder climates by comparing our predictions in Bozeman, Montana to those from a place with lower ambient temperatures (Fairbanks, Alaska). Contrary to our expectations, the 14°C differential between these regions was not as important as the potential differences in wind speed. These large increases in energetic demands can be mitigated by either increasing consumption rates or decreasing other energy demands. Data from GPS-collared wolves indicated that healthy wolves move, on average, 17 km per day, which was reduced by 1.5, 1.8, and 6.5 km for light, medium, and severe hair loss. In addition, the wolf with the most hair loss was less active at night and more active during the day, which is the converse of the movement patterns of healthy wolves. At the individual level, mange infections create significant energy demands and altered behavioral patterns, this may have cascading effects on prey consumption rates, food web dynamics, predator-prey interactions, and scavenger communities.},

	abstract = {Selection for signal efficacy (detectability) is an important factor driving the evolution of chromatic signals. Communication theory predicts that colour signals should evolve to show those properties that maximize their conspicuousness to receivers in their own visual environment. In the ventrally polymorphic lizard Podarcis muralis, visual modelling has shown morph-specific differences in chromatic conspicuousness (orange {\textgreater} yellow {\textgreater} white). Although this suggests that morphs may incur different detectability costs, the differences in conspicuousness could be compensated behaviourally if individuals of the more conspicuous morphs adopted postures that made their colour patches less visible. We quantified the degree of exposure of the lizard ventral and ventrolateral coloration in the field to investigate the relationship between body posture and colour morph. We used a classification based on four lizard postures, from ventral surface completely hidden to full exposure of the ventral and ventrolateral colour patches (when lizards extend their forelegs and raise the head). As these postures may have consequences for thermoregulation, we also recorded substrate and lizard body temperatures using a thermographic camera. Results did not reveal differences among morphs in the frequency with which they adopt postures that expose their colour patches. In contrast, we found a strong relationship between body temperature and lizard posture. Overall, our results support the view that, regardless of colour morph, perching wall lizards adopt the elevated postures that maximize exposure of their ventral colour patches only when their body temperature is high enough to allow for an efficient predator avoidance response.Significance statementSelection for effective communication favours flashy, highly conspicuous coloration, but conspicuousness also makes colour signals more detectable to unintended receivers (e.g. predators). Some animals offset the costs associated with conspicuous coloration by evolving compensatory traits. In the lizard P. muralis, ventral colour morphs differ in conspicuousness and we hypothesized that the most conspicuous morphs might compensate for their increased conspicuousness by adopting postures that minimize exposure of their conspicuous colour patches. Results show that the morph-specific differences in conspicuousness are not compensated behaviourally. In contrast, we found a strong relationship between body temperature and lizard posture, suggesting that lizards, regardless of colour morph, adopt postures exposing their conspicuous colour patches only when their body temperature allows for an efficient predator avoidance response.},

How amphibious fishes cope with the risks of rising water temperatures may depend, in part, on the plasticity of behavioural mechanisms such as emersion thresholds. We hypothesized that the emersion threshold is reversibly plastic and thus dependent on recent acclimation history rather than on conditions during early development. Kryptolebias marmoratus were reared for 1 year at 25 or 30°C and acclimated as adults (one week) to either 25 or 30°C before exposure to an acute increase in water temperature. The emersion threshold temperature and acute thermal tolerance were significantly increased in adult fish acclimated to 30°C, but rearing temperature had no significant effect. Using a thermal imaging camera, we also showed that emersed fish in a low humidity aerial environment (30°C) lost significantly more heat (3.3°C min−1) than those in a high humidity environment (1.6°C min−1). In the field, mean relative humidity was 84\%. These results provide evidence of behavioural avoidance of high temperatures and the first quantification of evaporative cooling in an amphibious fish. Furthermore, the avoidance response was reversibly plastic, flexibility that may be important for tropical amphibious fishes under increasing pressures from climatic change.},

Thermal microhabitat structure, lizard temperature, and substrate preference were simultaneously evaluated using thermal imaging. A broad range of microhabitat temperatures was available (mean range of 11°C within 1–2 m2) while mean lizard temperature was between 36°C and 38°C. Lizards selected sites that differed significantly from the mean environmental temperature, indicating behavioral thermoregulation, and maintained a temperature significantly above that of their perch (mean difference of 2.6°C).

	abstract = {Homeostatic responses of animals to environmentally induced changes in nutrient requirements provide a powerful basis for predictive ecological models, and yet, such responses are virtually unstudied in the wild. We tested for macronutrient-specific compensatory feeding responses by free-ranging golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) inhabiting high altitude temperate forests, where they experience a substantial difference in ambient temperature in cold winters vs. warmer springs. The monkeys had free access to natural foods throughout the year, and to ensure that any seasonal differences in nutrient intake were due to homeostatic compensation and not constraints on food availability, we studied the monkeys during periods in which they were provisioned with the same amount of supplementary foods in winter and spring. Thermoregulatory energy costs in winter and spring were calculated using partitional calorimetric estimations of convective and radiative heat loss obtained from thermal imaging of free-ranging monkeys in situ. Daily nutrient intakes were measured using continuous focal follows (average 6.9 hr/day) of free-ranging individuals (27 days in spring and 28 days in winter). We used a nutritional geometry framework to integrate these data and test three predictions: (a) In order to remain thermoneutral (balance heat loss with heat expenditure), golden snub-nosed monkeys increase daily energy consumption during the winter compared to spring; (b) this increase is achieved specifically by increasing intake of the primary energetic nutrients, carbohydrate and lipid, relative to protein; and (c) the seasonal increase in ingested fat and carbohydrate calories will quantitatively match the additional thermoregulatory costs in winter compared with spring. Our results showed that daily metabolisable energy intake in winter (721.5 kJ/mbm) was 1.8 times that in spring (399 kJ/mbm). As predicted, this difference was specific to fat and carbohydrate, whereas seasonal protein intake did not differ significantly. Winter consumption of fat and carbohydrate was 326 kJ/mbm per day greater than in spring, a value that closely matched the seasonal difference in the daily energetic costs of thermoregulation (329 kJ/mbm). This is the first study to test for a match between nutrient-specific homeostatic compensation and environmentally induced perturbations in nutrient requirements in free-ranging animals and underpins the potential for the homeostasis framework to provide predictive power to ecological models.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic variation within biological systems is ubiquitous and often assumed to be adaptive in social insects. Local environmental factors, such as temperature, may affect the phenotypic variation produced, and yield insights into the mechanisms that generate this group-level outcome. For instance, fine-scale heterogeneity in temperature across the nest may generate phenotypic variation by affecting larval development directly, or indirectly by inducing changes in the behavior of group members. To understand the role of temperature in producing phenotypic variation, we studied whether microclimatic differences within the nest could produce the worker size variation commonly observed in bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies. We also tested if changes to the ambient temperature that colonies are exposed to influences the size variation they produced. We recorded brood temperature via thermal imaging and measured thorax widths of workers produced by colonies kept at ambient temperatures of 30 and 20 °C. Overall, average brood temperature did not differ across the nest even while the average temperature of non-brood structures (i.e., honeypots) interspersed among the brood decreased towards the periphery, demonstrating that bees were able to regulate brood temperature at a fine scale. However, we found that the size variation produced was sensitive to ambient temperature and increased under warmer temperatures. These results demonstrate that bumble bees have a unique method of fine-grained thermoregulation, where they regulate brood temperature but not the regions between brood. Additionally, while temperature is not the mechanism that produces size variation, it indirectly influences the mechanism that does.Significance statementMorphological variation among group members affects group performance. We studied how the thermal environment experienced by developing workers, i.e., brood, influences the between-worker size variation produced within B. impatiens colonies. We found that temperature only indirectly influences size variation, as size variation increased under warmer nest temperatures, yet the temperature of brood did not differ across the nest. Our finding that workers maintain a uniform environment for the brood differs from previous results examining feeding rates across the nest and suggests that while the same workers tend to feed and thermoregulate the brood, they do so according to different rules and that by influencing worker behaviors, such as feeding rate, temperature affects size variation.},

	abstract = {We quantified the transpiration cooling effect by comparing a living climber greenwall (CGW) against a real but non-transpiring one after confirming the cessation of transpiration and similar vegetation coverages of both of them. We severed stems of plants in one of the CGWs to stop transpiration. By monitoring the changes in transpiration rate, leaf temperature, and percentage coverages of plants with and without severance of stems, we tried to confirm the cessation of transpiration and similar vegetation coverages. In parallel with it, we measured the indoor thermal environments in the well-covered houses of the two treatments, as well as a non-covered house, and calculated the transpiration cooling effect. The transpiration rates of plants with stem severance dropped to less than 1.0mmolm−2s−1 within 35min after severance. Almost all leaf temperatures in the severed treatment were similar to the dry reference leaf temperatures. In contrast, those in the non-severed treatment remained the same as before severance. In addition, the percentage points of percentage coverages between the living CGW and the real but non-transpiring one was reduced to just 1.5\% two days after severance. Thus, we quantified the transpiration cooling effect of CGWs using the indoor thermal environmental data two days after severance. The average transpiration cooling effect calculated from the indoor wall surface temperatures (=severed plant-covered house−intact plant-covered house) was 0.23°C, although the average shading cooling effect (=non-covered house−severed plant-covered house) was 8.55°C under global solar radiation on a vertical south surface between 400 and 600Wm−2. In addition, those calculated from room temperatures under the same environmental conditions were 0.15 and 4.00°C, respectively. Therefore, we concluded that the transpiration cooling effect of CGWs, which were separately set from the walls, on the indoor thermal environment of houses was much smaller than the shading cooling effect. Using these methodologies, we recommend further investigation of the appropriate distance between CGWs and walls to increase the transpiration cooling effect.},

Within the urban area, the mean LST of urban impervious surfaces was about 6–12 °C higher than that of the urban green space. LSTs of built-up areas were on average 3–6 °C higher than LSTs of rural areas. The observations for surface radiation and heat fluxes indicated that the differences were caused by different fractions of sensible heat or latent heat flux in net radiation. LSTs decreased with increasing elevation and normalized difference vegetation index.ConclusionsVariations in building materials and urban structure significantly influenced the spatial pattern of LSTs in urban areas. By contrast, elevation and vegetation cover are the major determinants of the LST pattern in rural areas. To alleviate urban heat island intensity, urban planners and policy makers should pay special attention to the selection of appropriate building materials, the reasonable arrangement of urban structures, and the rational design of landscape components.},

	abstract = {Infrared thermography (IRT) is being increasingly utilised by animal physiologists and ecologists to investigate the role of thermal stress and small-scale thermal variability on the distribution and abundance of species. Due to the inability of infrared cameras to work underwater, ecological studies that use IRT have largely been undertaken on terrestrial systems, while fundamentally limited to surfacing mammals in aquatic ecosystems. In recent years, however, IRT has been used to investigate the thermal ecology of intertidal organisms, which are intermittently exposed. The aim of this paper was to summarise the rapidly growing application of IRT in marine ecology, to discuss best practises for using IRT in the marine environment whilst outlining some common limitations, and to suggest future research directions. IRT has been successfully used to count and track the movements of a range of marine mammals as well as to quantify previously unobserved nocturnal feeding patterns. On rocky intertidal shores, IRT has largely been used to assess thermoregulatory processes in gastropods, mussels and sea stars and the effect of heat stress on barnacle recruitment. Ground-truthing and calibration procedures still remain the largest drawback for the use of IRT in ecological studies. However, once the appropriate calculations and working procedures have been implemented, thermal imaging is a reliable and rapid tool for measuring environmental and biological temperature variability. We believe such techniques will become increasingly popular as global temperatures, and hence thermal stress, continue to rise.},

	abstract = {For rocky intertidal invertebrates, the transition from pelagic larva to benthic settler represents a critical life-history stage characterised by high mortality. This mortality has been attributed to biotic factors such as predation or individual larval quality, as well as to abiotic factors such as thermal or desiccation stresses. Surprisingly little is known about how temperature varies at very fine spatial scales relevant to newly settled larvae. We used infrared (IR) imagery to determine (1) whether in situ rocky substrates during aerial exposure exhibit repeatable fine-scale (1 mm) temperature variation at the larval scale, and (2) whether the presence of adult conspecifics ameliorates effects of substratum temperature and promotes early growth and survival of settlers. We tracked the settlement and early survival of larvae to determine whether fine-scale variation in temperature influences early life history processes of the intertidal barnacle Tesseropora rosea. Larval settlement did not vary with fine-scale variation in rock temperature, but early post-settlement growth and survival were both inversely related to temperature. Furthermore, we found that rock temperatures decreased significantly with increasing proximity to adult T. rosea and that larvae that settled within 15 mm of adults survived better than those that settled within 16 to 30 mm, highlighting positive effects of gregarious settlement. This is partially explained by conspecific adults shading rock and reducing rock temperatures. We present the first use of IR technology to test for variation in rock temperature at a scale relevant to individual larvae, demonstrating that such fine-scale variation in thermal stress impacts the early-life history stages of a benthic marine invertebrate.},

	abstract = {Stomatal conductance of plants exposed to elevated CO2 is often reduced. Whether this leads to water savings in tall forest-trees under future CO2 concentrations is largely unknown but could have significant implications for climate and hydrology. We used three different sets of measurements (sap flow, soil moisture and canopy temperature) to quantify potential water savings under elevated CO2 in a ca. 35 m tall, ca. 100 years old mixed deciduous forest. Part of the forest canopy was exposed to 540 ppm CO2 during daylight hours using free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC). Across species and a wide range of weather conditions, sap flow was reduced by 14\% in trees subjected to elevated CO2, yielding ca. 10\% reduction in evapotranspiration. This signal is likely to diminish as atmospheric feedback through reduced moistening of the air comes into play at landscape scale. Vapour pressure deficit (VPD)-sap flow response curves show that the CO2 effect is greatest at low VPD, and that sap flow saturation tends to occur at lower VPD in CO2-treated trees. Matching stomatal response data, the CO2 effect was largely produced by Carpinus and Fagus, with Quercus contributing little. In line with these findings, soil moisture at 10 cm depth decreased at a slower rate under high-CO2 trees than under control trees during rainless periods, with a reversal of this trend during prolonged drought when CO2-treated trees take advantage from initial water savings. High-resolution thermal images taken at different heights above the forest canopy did detect reduced water loss through altered energy balance only at {\textless}5 m distance (0.44 K leaf warming of CO2-treated Fagus trees). Short discontinuations of CO2 supply during morning hours had no measurable canopy temperature effects, most likely because the stomatal effects were small compared with the aerodynamic constraints in these dense, broad-leaved canopies. Hence, on a seasonal basis, these data suggest a {\textless}10\% reduction in water consumption in this type of forest when the atmosphere reaches 540\% ppm CO2.},

The communities represent a complexity transect from primary vegetation, to transitional community, economic plantation, and fallows and are typical for Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. The indicators of ecosystem self-organization are sensitive to plant community type and seasonality, and demonstrate that the tropical seasonal rainforest is highly self-organized and plays an important role in local environmental stability via the land surface thermal regulation. The rubber plantation is at a very low level of self-organization as quantified by the thermodynamic indicators, especially during the dry season. The expansion of the area of rubber plantation and shrinkage of tropical seasonal rainforest would likely induce local surface warming and a larger daily temperature range.},

However, at odds with this are some sub-Antarctic islands that have plant species with giant growth forms and large, brightly coloured flowers which require insect visitation for pollination. The size, colour and shape of the inflorescences and leaves of these megaherbs suggest thermal benefits similar to giant tropical alpine plants of equatorial Africa, South America and Hawaii. We evaluated whether heating occurs in sub-Antarctic megaherbs, and to what extent it is related to environmental variables. We measured leaf and inflorescence temperature in six sub-Antarctic megaherb species on Campbell Island, latitude 52.3°S, New Zealand Biological Region. Using thermal imaging techniques, in combination with measurement of solar radiation, ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind chill and humidity, we assessed environmental influences on leaf and floral heating. We found that leaf and inflorescence temperatures of all megaherbs were higher than simultaneously measured ambient temperatures. Greatest heating was seen in Pleurophyllum speciosum, with observed leaves 9°C higher, and inflorescences nearly 11°C higher, than ambient temperature. Heating was highly correlated with brief, unpredictable periods of solar radiation, and occurred most rapidly in species with hairy, corrugated leaves and darkly pigmented, densely packed inflorescences. This is the first evidence that floral and leaf heating occurs in sub-Antarctic megaherbs, and suggests that leaf hairiness, flower colour and shape could provide thermal benefits like those seen in tropical alpine megaherbs.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the effects of thermal conditions on animal movement and dispersal is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of the consequences of climate change and habitat fragmentation. In particular, the flight of ectothermic insects such as small butterflies is greatly influenced by ambient temperature. Here, variation in body temperature during flight is investigated in an ecological model species, the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Attention is paid on the effects of flight metabolism, genotypes at candidate loci, and environmental conditions. Measurements were made under a natural range of conditions using infrared thermal imaging. Heating of flight muscles by flight metabolism has been presumed to be negligible in small butterflies. However, the results demonstrate that Glanville fritillary males with high flight metabolic rate maintain elevated body temperature better during flight than males with a low rate of flight metabolism. This effect is likely to have a significant influence on the dispersal performance and fitness of butterflies and demonstrates the possible importance of intraspecific physiological variation on dispersal in other similar ectothermic insects. The results also suggest that individuals having an advantage in low ambient temperatures can be susceptible to overheating at high temperatures. Further, tolerance of high temperatures may be important for flight performance, as indicated by an association of heat-shock protein (Hsp70) genotype with flight metabolic rate and body temperature at takeoff. The dynamics of body temperature at flight and factors affecting it also differed significantly between female and male butterflies, indicating that thermal dynamics are governed by different mechanisms in the two sexes. This study contributes to knowledge about factors affecting intraspecific variation in dispersal-related thermal performance in butterflies and other insects. Such information is needed for predictive models of the evolution of dispersal in the face of habitat fragmentation and climate change.},

Heat transfer theory predicts that metabolic heat loss in this species will mostly depend on radiative and convective cooling. To examine this, thermal imaging of emperor penguins was undertaken at the breeding colony of Pointe Géologie in Terre Adélie (66°40′ S 140° 01′ E), Antarctica in June 2008. During clear sky conditions, most outer surfaces of the body were colder than surrounding sub-zero air owing to radiative cooling. In these conditions, the feather surface will paradoxically gain heat by convection from surrounding air. However, owing to the low thermal conductivity of plumage any heat transfer to the skin surface will be negligible. Future thermal imaging studies are likely to yield further insights into the adaptations of this species to the Antarctic climate.},

In the present study, two pilot 20 m2 extensive green roofs were implemented in an urban Mediterranean region, at a 1st storey on a warehouse building structure, in order to test the adequacy of different substrates for supporting aromatic plants (Lavandula dentata, Helichrysum italicum, Satureja montana, Thymus caespititius and Thymus pseudolanuginosus). Experimental substrates included expanded clay and granulated cork as main components, supplemented with organic matter and crushed egg shell. A commercial substrate that obeys to FLL guidelines was also tested. Plant growth was assessed and compared within each platform. All experimental substrates proved to be adequate for vegetation growth, with the combination of 70\% expanded clay, 15\% organic matter and 15\% crushed egg shell showing the best results regarding plant establishment and growth over time. Water runoff quality parameters - turbidity, pH, conductivity, NH4 +, NO3 −, PO4 3− - met standard values required for water reuse for non-potable purposes, such as toilet flushing or irrigation. Preliminary qualitative thermographic measurements comparing surface temperature of different plant species and the substrate showed that temperature of vegetation surface was lower than substrate, reinforcing green roofs benefits of lowering air temperature in their surroundings. The present research shows that aromatic vegetation combined with clay substrates are suitable for green roofs located in countries of the Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are hyper-diverse and perform critical functions that regulate global climate, yet they are also threatened by rising temperatures. Canopy temperatures depart considerably from air temperatures, sometimes by as much as air temperatures are projected to increase by the end of this century; however, canopy temperatures are rarely measured or considered in climate change analyses. Our results from near-continuous thermal imaging of a well-studied tropical forest show that canopy temperatures reached a maximum of 34°C, and exceeded maximum air temperatures by as much as 7°C. Comparing different canopy surfaces reveals that bark was the warmest, followed by a deciduous canopy, flowers, and coolest was an evergreen canopy. Differences among canopy surfaces were largest during afternoon hours, when the evergreen canopy cooled more rapidly than other canopy surfaces, presumably due to transpiration. Gross primary productivity (GPP), estimated from eddy covariance measurements, was more strongly associated with canopy temperatures than air temperatures or vapor pressure deficit. The rate of GPP increase with canopy temperatures slowed above 28–29°C, but GPP continued to increase until 31–32°C. Although future warming is projected to be greater in high-latitude regions, we show that tropical forest productivity is highly sensitive to small changes in temperature. Important biophysical and physiological characteristics captured by canopy temperatures allow more accurate predictions of GPP compared to commonly used air temperatures. Results suggest that as air temperatures continue to warm with climate change, canopy temperatures will increase at a 40\% higher rate, with uncertain but potentially large impacts on tropical forest productivity.},

Recent developments in determining the mechanism of genes with roles in freezing tolerance and the systems involved in low-temperature gene regulation and signal transduction are described.

The UHI detection was performed using air temperatures at both the roof and the street levels (using fixed-station and car-traverse measurements) and at the surface level (using an airborne thermal video radiometer [TVR]). Whereas the complex microscale characteristics of the UHI studied by the TVR at the surface level showed variations of up to 10°C, at the street level, air temperature variations of 3–5°C were identified between the city center and the surrounding areas. It was found that during the nighttime, the warm Mediterranean Sea has a moderating effect on the roof-level temperatures, whereas, at the street level, the urban heat island is more pronounced. The combined method of monitoring the UHI from different levels and on different scales for the first time enabled a spatial assessment of the city’s UHI and its diverse thermal coverage characteristics. The thermal differences of neighborhoods, urban activity and urban components were compared. It was demonstrated that the city cover plays an important role in the thermal activity of Tel-Aviv. A similar UHI spatial pattern was obtained using isotherm maps, generated from the air temperatures at street level, and thermal images, generated by the TVR at the surface level. It was concluded that there are differences in the magnitude of the UHI at different levels of the canopy layer and at different times, but the UHI pattern has similar trends.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Adverse environmental conditions constrain active flight and thereby limit reproduction in most insects. Butterflies have evolved various adaptations in order to thermoregulate, allowing females to search for nectar and to oviposit under unfavorable thermal conditions. We studied experimentally and with observational data the effect of low ambient temperatures experienced in the morning on the timing of oviposition and clutch size in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Comparisons were made between individuals with different forms of the gene Pgi, encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase, since naturally segregating variation at Pgi is known to be correlated with flight metabolic rate, flight performance, and fecundity. Experiencing low temperature in the morning delayed the initiation of oviposition and decreased clutch size. We used a thermal image camera to measure the thoracic surface temperature of butterflies immediately after voluntary flight. Single nucleotide polymorphism at Pgi was associated with thoracic temperature at low ambient temperatures. This has consequences for reproduction because females that are able to fly at lower ambient temperatures generally initiate oviposition earlier in the afternoon, when the environmental conditions are most favorable and the average egg clutch size is generally largest. These results suggest that variation in physiological and molecular capacity to sustain active flight at low ambient temperature has significant fitness‐related consequences in insects.},

We performed an integrative study of wing pigmentation in calopterygid damselflies, combining phylogenetic comparative analyses, field observations and experiments. We investigated the evolutionary consequences of wing pigmentation for sexual dimorphism, speciation, and extinction and addressed the possible thermoregulatory benefits of pigmentation. First, we reconstructed ancestral states of male and female phenotypes and traced the evolutionary change of wing pigmentation. Clear wings are the ancestral state and that pigmentation dimorphism is derived, suggesting that sexual selection results in sexual dimorphism. We further demonstrate that pigmentation elevates speciation and extinction rates. We also document a significant biogeographic association with pigmented species primarily occupying northern temperate regions with cooler climates. Field observations and experiments on two temperate sympatric species suggest a link between pigmentation, thermoregulation, and sexual selection, although body temperature is also affected by other phenotypic traits such as body mass, microhabitat selection, and thermoregulatory behaviors. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for wing pigmentation in sexual selection in males and in speciation. Wing pigmentation might not increase ecological adaptation and species longevity, and its primary function is in sexual signaling and species recognition.},

We combined two recent technologies, thermographie imaging and high-speed digital videography, to show that the wing-beat frequency during courtship (i.e., courtship intensity) in a damselfly, Mnais costalis, is correlated with thorax temperature. Our data indicated that (1) male thorax temperature was associated with solar exposure in his territory, (2) environmentally derived thermal gain enhanced courtship intensity, (3) hotter males were more likely to copulate than others, and (4) female thorax temperature during oviposition within a territory was associated with solar exposure. Males with territories that have longer exposure to sun spots are expected to attain higher thorax temperatures for longer and so are able to successfully court more females. We suggest that females benefit from mating with hot males because they will be on a warmer territory while ovipositing.Hot males might also have greater mate guarding ability, and/or eggs may develop faster in warmer territories.},

Two sets of experiments were designed to separately test the effect of convective heating and radiative heating on ignition of cardboard fuel samples. An air torch was used to provide the convective heating, and a crib fire was used for the radiative heating. An infrared thermography technique developed in our laboratory was used to obtain thermal profiles/signature of the heated cardboard sample surface under two different heating rates, from which the surface temperature change was obtained as a function of heating time. We found that radiation effects increased with an increase in the cardboard sample surface area exposed to radiation while the effects from convection dominated the smaller surface area samples. This finding qualitatively explains the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) original findings that millimeter diameter pine needles cannot be ignited by radiation only, even under a long duration fire generated radiant heat flux of an average 10.3 kW/m2. Our experimental results also justify the use of the cardboard fuelbeds to simulate fire behavior of large scale forest fires.},

In this paper, thermography was used to determine the temperature of leaves, stems and branch kerfs of Japanese spindle (Euonymus japonicus Thunb.) and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum Ait.) in the city of Jinan in China during winter. The temperatures of the leaves, stems and branch kerfs were monitored as the temperature decreased after the sample was subjected to hand heating or after the branch was cut. Differences in the specific heats and the latent heats of the leaves, branches and stems with different water contents and transpiration capacities were confirmed. The significant temperature difference obtained after hand heating between different leaf sections with varied water contents made it easy to obtain the thermal images, which were clear and exhibited reduced systematic errors. After hand heating, a significantly higher temperature was found at the major vein system of both Japanese spindle and glossy privet. This increased temperature difference made it possible to detect the water and the thermal state of these leaves. Therefore, it was possible to detect scorched area of the leaves, the twig dieback and the sap warming phenomenon in the leaves using thermography. In addition, the leaf bending phenomenon observed in Japanese spindle leaves during the deep freezing process indicates that the leaf scorch symptoms result from water stress and a lack of sap warming.},

	abstract = {The ornamental value of many trees is often based on their special colour, shape and structures. Its autumn leaf colour makes sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) a favourable ornamental tree species for landscape beautification and urban greening. In addition to specific genetic control, to some extent, environment plays an important role in sweet gum colour changes. In this study, leaf-reddening events in the individual leaves and crowns of sweet gum trees were studied by analysing the ecology of sweet gum trees planted on a gradient of soil types, by comparing pruned and unpruned trees, by severing certain leaf veins and by measuring the snapping strength of the petiole. High-temperature areas on the severed leaves were detected using thermography. Low stomatal conductance and high leaf temperature rapidly appeared at the stressed area in severed lobes because of water stress and a related transpiration-cooling failure, especially in direct sunshine or on dry, hot summer days. The consistent relationship between the reddened and high-temperature areas indicates that a persistent transpiration-cooling failure resulted in local-area reddening on sweet gum leaves and the formation of a protective layer with high anthocyanin content. A significant relation between the snapping strength of the petiole and leaf reddening suggests that a persistent water imbalance during the formation of the abscission zone accelerates the sweet gum leaf reddening. Namely, a persistent transpiration-cooling failure during the defoliation process induces protective responses of the leaf. The rapid water loss of sweet gum juvenile leaves indicates that the reddening of the leaves may be a sensitive response to the changing properties of the leaf cuticle.},

	abstract = {Maintaining insulative fat stores is vital for homeothermic marine mammals foraging in cold polar waters. To accomplish this, animals must balance acquisition and expenditure of energy. If this balance is shifted, body condition can decrease, challenging thermal homeostasis and further affecting energy balance. Prior studies of temperature regulation in sea lions have neither quantified basic all-inclusive heat flux values for animals swimming in cold water, nor determined whether they exhibit consistent spatial patterns of heat flux. Heat flux and skin temperature data were thus collected from four captive Steller sea lions using heat flux sensors (HFSs) with embedded thermistors. Optimal sensor placement was established using infrared thermography to locate the major areas of heat flux along the surface of the animals. Experiments were conducted on swimming animals in a large habitat tank with and without a drag harness, and on stationary animals in a temperature- and current-controlled swim flume. All heat flux measurements were corrected by a previously determined correction factor of 3.42 to account for insulative effects of the HFSs and attachment mechanism. Heat flux from shoulders and hips was consistently greater than from mid-trunk and axillary areas in both swimming and stationary animals, suggesting that certain areas of the body are preferentially used to offload excess heat. Mean heat flux for animals swimming with a drag harness was significantly greater than for unencumbered animals, indicating a likely increase in heat production beyond minimum heat loss. Thus, thermal stress does not appear to constitute significant costs for Steller sea lions swimming under conditions of increased drag at speeds of approximately 1 m/s in water temperatures of approximately 8.0 °C.},

	abstract = {Over ontogeny, many insect larvae grow substantially, through at least several orders of magnitude in body size. Increasing size can profoundly change how individuals interact with their environments, by altering the opportunities for, and constraints on, feeding, changing the relative risk and sources of predation and shifting the relative importance of physical factors in the environment. Here I use eggs and larvae of Manduca sexta, which are herbivores on solanaceous plants in the south-western US, to examine how body size affects body temperature. Larvae grow in excess of 10 000-fold by mass in a few weeks, from 0·001-g hatchlings to 12–15-g fifth-instar larvae. Using infrared thermography, I show that increasing body size leads to large changes in body temperature: over ontogeny, average larval temperature increased by 3–7 °C. The temperatures of eggs, hatchlings and early larval instars were coupled to leaf temperatures (Datura wrightii), which were much cooler than ambient air temperatures. The temperatures of larger larvae, by contrast, were similar to air temperatures, or somewhat higher. Changing body temperatures reflect that small and large larvae were immersed differentially in leaf boundary layers, received different amounts of incoming solar radiation, and used thermal heterogeneity on leaf surfaces in different ways. I develop a simple species distribution model that links maximum observed air temperatures in the south-western US with known thermal tolerances of eggs and larvae. This model predicts that eggs of M. sexta can occupy significantly larger fractions of the landscape than can large larvae. Large differences among stage-specific microclimates, such as those observed for M. sexta, are likely to be general features for insects and other organisms whose body sizes span large ranges, and stage-specific microclimates pose general and largely unrecognized problems for species distribution models.},

	abstract = {Morphology mediates the relationship between an organism's body temperature and its environment. Dark organisms, for example, tend to absorb heat more quickly than lighter individuals, which could influence their responses to temperature. Therefore, temperature-related traits such as morphology may affect patterns of species abundance, richness, and community assembly across a broad range of spatial scales. In this study, we examined variation in color lightness and body size within butterfly communities across hot and cool habitats in the tropical woodland–rainforest ecosystems of northeast Queensland, Australia. Using thermal imaging, we documented the absorption of solar radiation relative to color lightness and wingspan and then built a phylogenetic tree based on available sequences to analyze the effects of habitat on these traits within a phylogenetic framework. In general, darker and larger individuals were more prevalent in cool, closed-canopy rainforests than in immediately adjacent and hotter open woodlands. In addition, darker and larger butterflies preferred to be active in the shade and during crepuscular hours, while lighter and smaller butterflies were more active in the sun and midday hours—a pattern that held after correcting for phylogeny. Our ex situ experiment supported field observations that dark and large butterflies heated up faster than light and small butterflies under standardized environmental conditions. Our results show a thermal consequence of butterfly morphology across habitats and how environmental factors at a microhabitat scale may affect the distribution of species based on these traits. Furthermore, this study highlights how butterfly species might differentially respond to warming based on ecophysiological traits and how thermal refuges might emerge at microclimatic and habitat scales.},

	abstract = {1. Behavioural adaptations of ectotherms to thermally heterogeneous environments are still overlooked in the literature despite the fact that organismal behaviour could enhance survival in the warming world. This is particularly critical in the intertidal where most ectotherms live at, or near to the upper limit of thermal tolerance. 2. This study investigated (i) the environmental factors determining the body temperatures of the intertidal gastropod Nerita atramentosa, (ii) the space-time variability in environmental and individual body temperatures and (iii) the potential variability in N. atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviours, i.e. microhabitat selection and aggregation. 3. Thermal imaging was used to assess the body temperatures of N. atramentosa and surrounding substrata over two seasons (autumn and summer), at two shore levels (low-vs. high-shore levels) within two habitats of different topographic complexity (rock platform and boulders) on the same rocky shore. 4. Snail body and substratum temperatures were significantly and positively correlated within each habitat at both seasons. Substratum temperature may thus be considered as a primary driver of body temperatures of organisms that attach to a substratum. Substratum temperature and other variables such as solar irradiance critically need to be integrated in climate-change models that use single climatic variables (e.g. air temperature) that are not necessarily correlated with individual body temperatures in nature. 5. The high space-time variability in both substratum and body temperatures reinforces the growing evidence that small spatial scale variations may surpass those observed at larger spatial scales. 6. Nerita atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviour under high thermal stress appeared to be habitat specific. 7. The small spatial scale heterogeneity in environmental and individual temperatures and in thermoregulatory behaviours has stressed the need to focus on body temperature patterns at the niche level and to integrate the organismal behaviour in climate-change models.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the death of 3,000–6,000 sea otters (Enhydra lutris) from exposure to AlaskaNorth Slope crude oil, and the cleaning and rehabilitation of hundreds. The washing and care methods developed during that experience provided standard protocols for treatment of oiled sea otters, largely still in use 20 years later. From 2004 to 2008 at the Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), we experimentally manipulated water type (salt–fresh) and temperature, and we monitored otter physiology, behavior, and thermal properties to evaluate recovery from washing in the absence of oil. We also dipped otters in canola oil, and were able to wash one otter naturally oiled with Monterey formation crude oil, using the same methods. Providing soft freshwater in recovery pools reduced recovery time substantially. Warming the freshwater appeared to offer additional benefits in some cases. Infrared thermography and subcutaneous temperature-sensitive passive integrated transponder tags were 2 new technologies that enhanced this research. The improved washing and care methods developed have the potential to reduce the time required for recovery of water repellency of sea otter pelage.},

	abstract = {Herbivory can influence ecosystem productivity, but recent evidence suggests that damage by herbivores modulates potential productivity specific to damage type. Because productivity is linked to photosynthesis at the leaf level, which in turn is influenced by atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, we investigated how different herbivore damage types alter component processes of photosynthesis under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO 2 . We examined spatial patterns in chlorophyll fluorescence and the temperature of leaves damaged by leaf-chewing, gallforming, and leaf-folding insects in aspen trees as well as by leaf-chewing insects in birch trees under ambient and elevated CO 2 at the aspen free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) site in Wisconsin. Both defoliation and gall damage suppressed the operating efficiency of photosystem II (ΦPSII) in remaining leaf tissue, and the distance that damage propagated into visibly undamaged tissue was marginally attenuated under elevated CO 2 . Elevated CO 2 increased leaft temperatures, which reduced the cooling effect of gall formation and freshly chewed leaf tissue. These results provide mechanistic insight into how different damage types influence the remaining, visibly undamaged leaf tissue, and suggest that elevated CO 2 may reduce the effects of herbivory on the primary photochemistry controlling photosynthesis.},
